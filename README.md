How about "12 Months Of Progress" on the home page?





Update Keywords for each page. They should include Dream Center, Jackson, TN and the content that someone might search for to land on that page.

Last link in the head should be your styles.css link

"Donate" in the nav should be "How to Help" or similar. When I click on Donate, I am probably ready to give and don't want to read more.

Calendar should fill the page and not be Claire's calendar. They may already have a gmail account and you could get them to send the code

Content for "Our Mission"

You might want to consider 3 different pics on the home page for "How We Do It"

Site looks REALLY nice. Good Job ladies!!!
