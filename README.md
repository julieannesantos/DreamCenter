Hello! We are JUlie Anne Santos, Claire Myers, and Lauren Shelton. Three seniors at Madison Academic. We created this site for the Dream Center, a local non-profit that we al love dearly. Over the course of creating this site, we have partnered with the DC to get information, but also so that we could create a site as closely to who they are and their hearts as possible. We have really loved the experience and how much the DC has meant to us over this project. Though we tried our best to get all information currently from the DC, some information we were not able to get so we used information we could find about them off their current website, their social medias, or articles about them. We wanted to show their hearts, because their hearts and their mission is the number one thing that sets them apart for us, so because of that we tried to display our site as a lively yet humble aesthetic.  So we used colors, fonts, and words that would draw women and children in since the Dream Center is for THEM, but also be apealing to the common giver/volunteer.
